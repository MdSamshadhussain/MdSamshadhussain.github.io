I am a Research Scholar at the Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, India. I have submitted my thesis and looking for a Postdoc position. During my Ph.D., I have worked on controllability of fractional dynamical systems and synchronization of fractional-order neural networks. 

Research Interest
======

My research focuses on stability, controllability of dynamical systems, and synchronization of neural networks, with potential applications in fields such as neural network, dynamical systems analysis, secure communication, and image processing. I am particularly enthusiastic about exploring new avenues in consensus of multi-agent systems and advancing the practical applications of neural network synchronization, such as in bio-inspired computing and adaptive control. Driven by a commitment to rigorous theoretical inquiry and interdisciplinary collaboration, my work aims to bridge foundational mathematical principles with real-world challenges. Through this, I strive to contribute meaningfully to the field of applied mathematics, addressing complex problems that intersect systems theory, computational neuroscience, and emerging technologies.
